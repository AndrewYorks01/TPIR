KNOWN ISSUES:

Bonkers:
Extremely rarely, the program will crash.

Hit Me:
The game is inconsistent with the way it treats the house's ace. For example, if the house has 
a hand of 18 (including an ace) and the player has a hand of 17, the player would win beacuse the 
game is consdering the possibility that the house is considering the ace 1 rather than 11.

Hurdles:
Rarely, the same grocery item can appear twice. (Maybe the randomization field
has two of the same number?)

Extremely rarely, the game won't work at all and the program will crash. (Maybe
the randomization field is generating an out-of-bounds number?)

Vend-o-Price:
The items on the shelf should be arranged in order from least to most expensive.
(This is a minor issue, but it might be worth looking into for accuracy's sake.)
